# GENERACIO-OpenSource
VR/XR Tools Built from the Ground Up - Powering Future Software and Hardware

## Introduction to GENERACIO
**GENERACIO** is a project that aims to make VR (primarily PCVR) more accessible.
Here you can track my progress, from building my own VR game engine to developing VR hardware.
This is the open-source version of the project, meaning only selected parts of my work are published here.

## Introduction to GENERACIO-OpenSource
This repository contains all the tools I've been working on for my project **GENERACIO**.
All of the code is open-source and free to use in your own project.

You can also help develop the project by creating a pull request!

## Current progress
+ A lightweight, extensible OpenGL/OpenXR engine in C++ **(KI ENGINE)**
+ More coming soon

## KI ENGINE
OpenGL and OpenXR engine, all in C++.

I recommend using **SteamVR** as the OpenXR runtime.
If you don't have a VR headset, but still want to test the code, use a [Dummy HMD](https://github.com/username223/SteamVRNoHeadset).

If you're using Visual Studio, make sure to set it to **Release x64** before building!
