# GENERACIO-OpenSource
VR/XR Tools Built from the Ground Up - Powering Future Software and Hardware

## Introduction to GENERACIO
**GENERACIO** is a project that aims to make VR (primarily PCVR) more accessible.
Here you can track my progress, from building my own VR game engine to developing VR hardware.
This is the open-source version of the project, meaning only selected parts of my work are published here.

## Introduction to GENERACIO-OpenSource
This repository contains all the tools I've been working on for my project **GENERACIO**.
All of the code is open source and free to use in your own project.
This is also where I'll publish my progress with the project.

## Current progress
+ Very basic and barebones OpenGL/OpenXR engine in C++ **(KI ENGINE)**
+ More coming soon
